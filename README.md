# W10CaptivePortalHandler

This is a really basic application that demonstrate how you could use a Windows 10 UWP application to handle captive portal when you use the Windows Firewall in block mode for (most) outgoing network connections and force a VPN (without using built-in automatic VPN) or a cloud proxy.
This have been coded very basicly as a Proof of Concept, this is not ment to be secured or to prevent attackers from bypassing this

This is not supported neither by Microsoft or myself, but feel free to use it or to enhace it
